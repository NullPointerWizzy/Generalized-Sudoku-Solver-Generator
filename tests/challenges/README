			   Sudoku Challenge
			  ==================

A level is considered as solved if your solver can count the number of
solution found ('--all' option) for all the grids in less than 5 mn.
For example, a typical run could be :

#> time (../sudoku --all level-03/*.sku > /dev/null)

real    0m6.720s
user    0m6.716s
sys     0m0.004s

You can also run a full contest by copying sudoku solvers in binaries/
and running the RunContest.sh script.


Leve1 1 and Level 2
-------------------
Grids can be solved with various "simple" heuristics.

Level 3
-------
Grids can be solved with all the previous heuristics plus, at most,
one choice (no full backtracking).

Level 4
--------
Grid can be solved only with backtracking, heuristics won't be enough.

Level 5
-------
Solving these grids requires to look at various algorithmic and
performance issues in order to get through.

Level 99
--------
Partially unexplored...
Solving one of these grids is already an achievement in itself.
